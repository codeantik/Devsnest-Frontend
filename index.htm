        <p><em><strong> Dear Dean, </strong></em></p>
        <p> This is to inform you that Devsnest is orgainising is a 30 day code camp for beginners. I attended this camp the past month and was overwhelmed by the quality of knowledge I gained during this short time. So, I request you to please grant the permission so that they can organise this camp for the students of the university.</p></br>
